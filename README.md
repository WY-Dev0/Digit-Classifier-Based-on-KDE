# Digit-Classifier-Based-on-KDE
Presents a novel approach to handwritten digit classification on the MNIST dataset using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) combined with advanced preprocessing techniques. This method achieves 89% accuracy on both training and test sets, significantly outperforming traditional KDE-based approaches, which typically achieve 84% accuracy. The key innovations include a sophisticated preprocessing pipeline combining PCA, ICA, mutual information-based feature selection, and Jensen-Shannon divergence-weighted pixel importance scoring.
